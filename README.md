# Daily dose of C-Programming

*Write a Code Daily (WACD) #1*

1. Write a C program that defines a function multiply() which takes two integers as parameters and returns their product. Call this function in main() and display the result.

2. Write a C function named isEven() that takes an integer as input and returns 1 if the number is even, otherwise returns 0. Use this function in main() to check whether a given number is even or odd.
